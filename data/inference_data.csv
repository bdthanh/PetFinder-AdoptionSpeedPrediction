They are all in good health and are very lively and adorable. Do take a look at some of their pictures and I hope you would at least fall in love with one.

When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times.

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful.

Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy. A great purrer, Swagger is also an accomplished kisser of noses. Swagger is toilet trained, clean, a good eater and a pleasant, well-mannered kitten, suitable for children and adults. Update May : Dear little Swagger got adopted on Mother's Day and was taken away to his forever home. Good luck, happy kitten!",2

He is fine with other cats - wants to play with my existing cats (unfortunately they don't want to play with him!). Valentine has received 2 vaccinations and will receive his final vaccination and spaying operation within the next week. He was originally adopted from me as a small kitten (see original photos) but the owner has changed jobs and Valentine has been returned to me. He is now looking for his forever home - I am looking for someone who can commit to caring for him for the rest of his life (>18 years potentially) so please think carefully before making a commitment. Adopter requirements: Valentine will probably be fine in a household with other cats (assuming they are OK with him of course!) but he needs to have individual attention to stay occupied so not suitable for a household with many other animals. He is very bold and affectionate so I think would also be good with children. Please contact me if you are interested to know more or to come and meet Valentine before you make a decision!",3

Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

Or you can send e-mail. These two kittens are Beel and ToraRawr. They are kids of on of the stray cats we feed.We picked them up from the mom...she didn't leave them willingly but they were weaned. So I kidnapped 3 of the kittens kept them inside, gave them bath, fed them etc. The third kitten seemed too scared without the mom and seemed a bit fragile so I left them to them mom, and now a resident of the backyard alley. He seems to be happier outside. We decided to do that because we felt responsible as we feed the adult cats and many kittens we feed just die or disappear before even reaching adulthood being attacked by dogs and other territorial adult cats. Recently one of our precious indoor-outdoor kitten of 10 months went missing; very sad. We love the kittens very much and feel attached to them but unable to take care of them for a long time. They need lots and lots of love, care and time. SO for a better living condition and care we are giving our beloved kittens away for adoption. Kitten's Description :- I'm guessing these 2 kittens share different genes combination. Beel has medium body structure and hair length. More fluffier than Tora. Tora is the bigger species type with normal hair. Beel has a square shaped face and Tora has a longer face... 1. Beel : -Female -Tri colour Fur, fur slightly longer than Tora's. -Yellow/orange eyes -Enjoys playing with toys -Purrs when playing fighting with human hands. ToraRawr(Tora): -Male -Orange fur. -Yellow/orange eyes -Lap cat type. -Eats a lot.Will eat as long as you feed. That's bad. Don't fall for that eyes when he begs for food. -Quite vocal. Meows lot more than Beel. General : These cats will grow up to be quite big when fed well as parents are big and tall cats. Eye colour will lighten as they grow into adulthood. Please try to neuter/spay them to continue to maintain their tame nature. especially Tora as the stray male cats here start to get territorial and fight when grown up. But Tora seems very soft. So he might have been a loser if left outside with the other cats. Conditions to adopt :- 1) Both siblings Beel & Tora are to be adopted as Pair and not separated. One will go berserk without the other if they know the other is missing. They're close. 2) Not giving them away for students who live alone.A family is better. Only adopt if someone will be at home watching over them without being left alone too long. 3) Make them live a good life. :D",2

In the midst of dying of hunger, luckily an angel came. He is the shop owner there, and he decided we should live, found all of us a temporarily foster home to take care of us.

Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",3

My rescuers think I got lost. My foster mama thinks I was abandoned. My vet thinks I was used for breeding. My foster grandmama thinks I was abused. No one really knows my story… no one really knows my pain. Only I know the suffering I have borne. Only I know the darkness I have travelled through. The sad truth is, I will never see light again. You see, I am blind. My previous owners did not take care of me the way they should have. My eyes and ears need meticulous daily care. My poor teeth need to have plaque-remover applied every day followed by gentle brushing. Because my teeth have deteriorated after years of neglect, I smell a little pungent. And that is where my insensitive foster mama thought it was okay to name me Smellanor! Oh, the nerve! Other dogs frighten me. I don’t mean to, but when I am afraid I attack. My foster mama says I am no real danger to anyone. Even if I do charge at another fur-dude or fur-dudette I always miss. To be honest, I seldom know where I am. Being plunged into a world of darkness is not easy. I keep bumping into things and falling into holes. My foster mama thinks it is hilarious to call me Stevie Wondress.

I am house-trained and extremely obedient. Never will I bark, or bite, or disappoint you. Never will I leave your side, until I leave this world.

As my home was under renovation I could not take it home, so it has been looked after by the vet for 6 weeks now and I will pay them.

We're seeking a potential adopter for the Cream Scottish Fold, while we continue to try our luck to bring the other cat with us. However, if the potential new family could give both cats a wonderful home, we would like both of them to be adopted together. Both cats are very close. They're mother and daughter. Separation will cause some distress to them so we don't want to do that unless it's absolutely necessary. Note: The cat for adoption is 2 years old and is currently recovering from a skin condition. Ideally, she will be better by the time she gets rehomed.. but if she doesn't. The potential adopter must promise to continue treatment. (We will supply the medication) The photo was taken before she fell sick. Below is a video of how she looks like now. (She needs patience from the new family to help her get better if she's not by the time of adoption.) The other cat is 3 years old. Both cats are quite shy and it takes them awhile to get used to strangers. But once they are comfortable with you, they're very sweet cats. All potential adopters will be screened and must agree to keep these cats indoors at all times. (No cages) They are apartment cats and have never been outside their entire lives. They do not know how to hunt and is incapable of killing anything. They are litter trained and don't scratch furniture if they have their large scratching pole and toys, which will be provided by us as well. Location: KLCC area. If you are interested in adopting our cats, please send us an email with a brief introduction about yourself and your family. Where you live (The area) and let us know if you have any current pets. Do include your contact details in your enquiry. ENQUIRIES WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED. *There is a mandatory adoption fee. The money will be donated to PAWs or Metta Cats to help other cats and dogs in need. Some information about the breed: Scottish Folds are not lap cats. They will only come sit close to you or on you when they feel like it. They do however, like laying on their backs to have their belly rubbed. Short-haired Scottish Folds are relatively low maintenance. These cats usually have a bath once a month, and brushed every now and again. (They don't really need to be brushed, but they like it.. so we do it.) Note: The cream coloured SF has a double-fold.. so there are more cartilage in her ears. This means her ears will need regular cleaning. Preferably on a daily basis. If not, 3 times a week would suffice too. The grey cat is more low maintenance. We clean her ears once a month. She's got a single fold, and her ears have lifted.. so there's isn't much of a fold left. We hope that these cats will go to a good permanent home. We're very sad about giving them up. So do not write to us if you intend to adopt just because they are pure breds, they're cute or because your child wants one. Breeding is out of the question as they have been sterilised. These cats will be extremely shy during the transition phase of going to a new home. The new family must have patience with them. Like adopting a real child.. don't expect a cuddle from them or getting them to come to you for a stroke immediately when you take them home. They need time to adjust to a new environment.. which will take 1 to 4 weeks or even longer.. (It depends on how they come to trust you)",2

Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury. Cranks is a free spirit and he loves exploring.",4

She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass).

Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",2

Crossed breed, and I just assumed from his eyes and ears that he is Javanese though! Because he looks a lot like he is mixed Javanese with domestic or with oriental! De-flea and all necessaries done already (Neutered not yet). White + cream color Very handsome with big blueish/greenish eyes. We already have wet & dry food, will be provided. And we will give him a shower, before handing him to you. Thanks :)",1

He needs special care because he has an injured paw. I didn't notice at first, but i later realised he was loosing his fingers due to this problem. The allergy was spreading to other paws but now he is better, he just needs care because he is allergic to any soil/sand/litter/or anything of that sort. The vet said, with care, his allergy might go in a year, but meanwhile the only solution is to use torn/ shredded paper or crystal litter only. For this reason he can't live outdoors.",2
